I'm thrilled to introduce Askible, a new Discord bot designed to simplify Q&A interactions on your server. Askible isn't just a bot; it's a tool that provides users with direct, accurate answers, saving them the time and effort of searching for information.

## How does Askible work?
So, how does Askible work? It's straightforward. You feed Askible with a set of questions and their corresponding answers. Once that's done, Askible takes over. When a user asks a question in a natural language, Askible automatically provides the matching answer from your pre-set list. It's like having a conversation with a knowledgeable friend.

## The Goal
The goal of Askible is to make information sharing on your server more efficient and user-friendly. It ensures that users get accurate answers quickly, enhancing their experience on your server.

## How to setup?

- /help - Get help with the bot.
- /add - Add a Q&A pair.
- /remove - Remove a Q&A pair.
- /show - Show a Q&A pair.
- /set-channel <#channel> - Set the channel where the bot will answer.
- /cancel - Cancel the current plan.
- /subscription - Get your subscription status.
- /support - Get support.
