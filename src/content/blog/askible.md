I'm thrilled to introduce Askible, a new Discord bot designed to simplify Q&A interactions on your server. Askible isn't just a bot; it's a tool that provides users with direct, accurate answers, saving them the time and effort of searching for information.

So, how does Askible work? It's straightforward. You feed Askible with a set of questions and their corresponding answers. Once that's done, Askible takes over. When a user asks a question in a natural language, Askible automatically provides the matching answer from your pre-set list. It's like having a conversation with a knowledgeable friend.

A key feature of Askible is the use of "alternatives". These are auto-generated variations of the original question which improve the precision of answers. This means that even if a user's question doesn't exactly match the original phrasing, Askible can still provide the correct answer. This feature enhances the user experience by ensuring accurate responses to a wider range of question phrasings.

The goal of Askible is to make information sharing on your server more efficient and user-friendly. It ensures that users get accurate answers quickly, enhancing their experience on your server.

Setting up Askible is a breeze with these simple commands:

/help - Get help with the bot.
/add - Add a Q&A pair.
/remove - Remove a Q&A pair.
/show - Show a Q&A pair.
/set-channel <#channel> - Set the channel where the bot will answer.
/cancel - Cancel the current plan.
/subscription - Get your subscription status.
/support - Get support.
/upgrade - Upgrade your plan.
/plans - Info about the available plans.
With Askible, your Discord server can become a more efficient and user-friendly space, where users can get the information they need just by asking a question.

I'm excited about the potential of Askible to transform Q&A interactions on Discord, and I can't wait for you to try it out. Stay tuned for more updates and features!
